# sudoku-solver
An attempt in programming the sudoku solving algorithm, as per my own understanding of how one should solve it.
Made on bootstrap-enabled HTML and pure JS code-behind. OOP was useful, though I haven't use classes.
Turns out hard sudokus cannot be solved by that simple methodology I knew from my school years.
Hard sudokus require some advanced methods (like X-Wing) without which my has 0 chances, no matter how many iteraions I go with.
